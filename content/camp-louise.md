Set against the backdrop of the picturesque Catoctin Mountains and nestled beside the serene Hashawha Lake, Camp Louise boasts a sprawling landscape that invites exploration and wonder, and stands as a haven of adventure, camaraderie, and cherished memories.

This camp holds a special place in our hearts and will be the backdrop for our unforgettable wedding. The groom's daughter, Emily, has created her own magical moments at Camp Louise for the past five years. Her adventures here have become an integral part of our story, and we can't wait to share this cherished place with all of you. Join us in celebrating love, friendship, and the spirit of togetherness in this extraordinary setting that has witnessed generations of stories and continues to inspire new beginnings. 

Camp Louise becomes Camp Newlywed – where the magic of the outdoors meets the magic of love.
