Your presence at our wedding is the greatest gift of all, and we are truly honored to have you share in our special day. As we begin this exciting new chapter in our lives, we are blessed to have all of the things we need and would instead like to kindly request that, should you wish to give a gift, you consider contributing to our Honeymoon Fund (*coming soon*). Your generous contribution will help us create cherished memories as we embark on our first adventure as newlyweds. Of course, the most important thing is your presence, and if you'd prefer not to give a gift, your love and support are more than enough. 

We can't wait to celebrate and create lasting memories with you all!
