Normally this would be the “Our Story” section, but we couldn’t have a wedding website without featuring our two dogs named Daisy – since without them, there would be no us. 

In the heart of our apartment building, two spirited dogs named Daisy ignited a friendship that grew into something beautiful. It all began at the dog park, where casual chats turned into shared laughter and genuine connection. Through walks, fetch games, and countless dog park meet-ups, our bond deepened, and a wonderful journey unfolded. Join us as we celebrate the unique path that our two Daisies paved, and let's create new memories together.
